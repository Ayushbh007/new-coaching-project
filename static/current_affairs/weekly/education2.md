The Indian government recently unveiled the New Education Policy (NEP) 2024, a comprehensive framework aimed at transforming the nation's education system. This policy envisions a holistic and multidisciplinary approach to learning, emphasizing critical thinking, creativity, and skill development. For UPSC aspirants, understanding the nuances of NEP 2024 is crucial from the perspectives of social justice, governance, and economic development.
